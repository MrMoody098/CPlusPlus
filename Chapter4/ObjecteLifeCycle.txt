//An object is region of storage that has a type and a value. 
//when you declare a variable you declare an object.
//A variable is simply an object 


ALLOCATION DEALLOCATION AND LIFETIME

//every object requires storage
we reserve storage in a process called ALLOCATION

//when your done you release the storage during DEALLOCATION

//LIFETIME is a running property that is bound by the objects storage duration
it begins once its contructor completes and it ends just before a destructor is invoked

//each object passes through these stages

    1. The object's storage duration begins, and storage is allocated.
    2.The objects contructor is called.
    3.The objects lifetime begins,
    4.You can use the object in your program.
    5.The object's lifetime ends,
    6.The object's destructor is called
    7.The objects storageduration ends, and storage is deallocated.#

MEMORY MANAGEMENT
    we must craft object lifetimes in c++ it is not the garbage collectors job
    creates faster code but programmers need more intement knoledge of MEMORY MANAGEMENT system

AUTOMATIC storage duration
